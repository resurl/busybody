# project ideas 
## programs
- shiritori/끝말잇기
- chord builder
- complex time signature metronome
- pokemon image identifier
- automated ubc course registration

## web apps
programs more likely to require a GUI
- restaurant randomizer
- voice-based journal
- open calendar: no need for login/auth
- organization dashboard -> unsatisfied with the disconnectedness of the google apps
- price tracker
- chat / instant messaging service
- something like eyebleach but aesthetic backgrounds (moving?) instead -> i keep looking back to my computer b/c lack of visual stimulation during studying
- customizable pomodoro timer
- flexible media checklist (movies, tv shows, anime, books, etc.)
- epub viewer that doesn't make me want to cry

## game dev
- tower defense
- tamagotchi
- rebuild of an older emulator: gba/nes? some claim it's way too difficult b/c of required hardware knowledge, so [chip8](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2017/12/13/chip8-emulator-webassembly-rust.html) or its simpler form [bytepusher](https://esolangs.org/wiki/BytePusher) is a solution
